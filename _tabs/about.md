I am an aspiring Data Scientist with over 1.5 years of experience in the Data Science field.  Currently, I am pursuing a Master's in Data Science at Drexel University, with an expected graduation date in June 2025. 
My initial fascination with Data Science ignited during my undergraduate studies when I delved into Statistical Modelling, which piqued my interest due to its applications, particularly in predictive modelling. I undertook a series of projects, such as predicting employee compensation, forecasting the success of NBA players' careers, and developing a news article summarizer. These projects nurtured a passion for the Data Science field and it put me on my career path today.

My academic background includes a strong foundation in key subjects, including Probability & Statistics, Linear Algebra, Statistical Modelling, Machine Learning, Data Mining & Analytics. Currently, at Drexel University, I am enhancing my skills through courses like Data Acquisition and Pre-Processing, which provide valuable insights into the early stages of the data lifecycle in a Data Science project. I have experience in programming languages like Python, C/C++, JavaScript, SQL, R, and MATLAB. Additionally, I am a Microsoft certified Azure AI Engineer and Azure Data Scientist. My practical experience in Data Science includes working part-time with a tech company in India. I contributed to the development of a machine learning solution for predicting company revenues and employee counts & also led a team of 3 in creating a Profit & Loss Dashboard. 

My post-graduation plans are centred around joining an AI company as a Data Scientist where I can continue to learn and contribute to the creation of AI tools that make the day-to-day life of humans easier.
