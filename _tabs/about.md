Iâ€™m a data scientist who enjoys turning messy, real-world data into decisions that matter. Right now, Iâ€™m pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Data Science at Drexel University, and Iâ€™ll be graduating in June 2025. But Iâ€™ve been in this space long enough to know itâ€™s not just about models, itâ€™s about **making things work**, especially when the data isnâ€™t perfect and the deadline is tomorrow.

My path started in undergrad when I took a course on statistical modeling. It was the first time I saw how math and code could work together to **predict the future**, and I was hooked. That curiosity led to a bunch of side projects, like predicting NBA player career success (yes, I had a little too much fun with that), building a news article summarizer, and estimating employee compensation using regression trees. I didnâ€™t know it then, but those projects set me on the track Iâ€™m on today.

Over time, Iâ€™ve grown into someone who can ship real solutions, not just notebooks. Iâ€™ve built forecasting dashboards that helped restaurant chains plan millions in revenue. Iâ€™ve worked with APIs, CRMs, Azure pipelines, and enough edge cases to know that production data science is as much about **engineering and empathy** as it is about algorithms.

My technical toolbox includes Python, SQL, R, PyTorch, XGBoost, Docker, Azure, and Streamlit, and Iâ€™m certified as an Azure AI Engineer and Data Scientist. But what really excites me now is **explainable AI**, real-time inference (like Triton Server deployments), and making AI more transparent and accessible.

Whether Iâ€™m mentoring students at Drexel, debugging ETL pipelines at 2 a.m., or building a resume generator from scratch (yes, I did that too), Iâ€™m always learning. My goal is simple: join an AI-first company where I can build things that **make peopleâ€™s lives easier**, even if they never see the code behind it.

If youâ€™re working on something in AI, fintech, healthcare, or just solving hard problems with data, Iâ€™d love to connect.
