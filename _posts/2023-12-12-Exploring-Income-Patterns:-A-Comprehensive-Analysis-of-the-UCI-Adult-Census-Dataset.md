### Abstract
This paper explores income patterns using the UCI Adult Census Dataset from 1994. This analysis aims to uncover intricate
relationships between various demographic factors as well as looks at the impact that hours worked have on income bracket
and marital status.

individual's income exceeds $50,000 per year based on census
data. This dataset was donated to the UCI Machine Learning
Repository on April 30, 1996, and has been a significant
resource for research in social science, particularly in the field
of machine learning.
