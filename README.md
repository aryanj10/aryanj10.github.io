# Aryan Jain Portfolio (Next.js)

This is a minimal scaffold for a portfolio and blog built with Next.js 14 (App Router) and Tailwind CSS. It includes placeholder pages for projects, experience, blog, about, contact, resume, and an admin panel.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at <http://localhost:3000>.

## Testing

Playwright smoke tests can be executed with:

```bash
npm test
```

## Notes

This repository currently contains static placeholder content. Sanity schemas, authentication, OG image generation, and production deployment to Vercel should be configured before launch.
